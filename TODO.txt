* show how long did it take to run all the commands
* add some nice icons to the actions (native ones ideally)
* help via qthelp would be nice
* add a settings dialog (remember window state, etc)
* add an about box
* rework the Runnable class so that it uses QProcess signals
  instead of handling it via waitFor...() functions
